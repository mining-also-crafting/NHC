### Full credit goes to [ShamanDorn](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/shamandorn/) on PlanetMinecraft!
They gave me permission to include this resource pack. I have edited the paths to fix an issue. \
Also updated the pack.mc.meta, applied [Plaster](https://www.blockbench.net/plugins/plaster) in [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) and used [PackSquash](https://github.com/ComunidadAylas/PackSquash) to squash it.
