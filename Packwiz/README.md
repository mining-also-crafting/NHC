# packwiz
[packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) is a command line tool for creating Minecraft modpacks. Instead of managing JAR files directly, packwiz creates TOML metadata files which can be easily version-controlled and shared with git (see an example pack [here](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-example-pack)).

See https://packwiz.infra.link/ for the full packwiz documentation!
